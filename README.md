# Clinical Trial eCRF Validation (Demo Project)

This is a demonstration project for a clinical trial electronic Case Report Form (eCRF), built as part of my portfolio for the NIHR Undergraduate Internship in Clinical Data Systems at Imperial Clinical Trials Unit (ICTU). It simulates a structured, validated form for a hypertension drug trial.

This project highlights my understanding of front-end development, validation logic, and automated testing principles for clinical research data systems.

## Features

- Multi-section eCRF layout using HTML5 and CSS3
- Real-time form validation and conditional logic using JavaScript
- Automated test specification using Cypress (demonstration code)
- Dynamic medication entry, calculated averages, and confirmation message
- Designed to reflect usability and good clinical practice (GCP) standards

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Cypress (E2E test specification only)
- Markdown for documentation
- End-to-End testing methodology (clinical context)
- Git for version control

---

## How to Run

1. Open `src/index.html` in a browser to use the form interface.
2. To run the Cypress test (optional):
   - Ensure Node.js is installed
   - Install Cypress: `npm install cypress --save-dev`
   - Open Cypress Test Runner: `npx cypress open`
   - Run the `form-validation.spec.js` file under `cypress/e2e/`

Note: The Cypress test spec is provided as a demonstration and has not yet been run due to system constraints.

## Internship Context

This project was created to support my application for the NIHR Undergraduate Internship in Clinical Data Systems at Imperial Clinical Trials Unit. It demonstrates:

- Automation scripting for eCRF validation
- Familiarity with data integrity requirements in clinical trials
- Motivation to apply software development in health and research contexts
